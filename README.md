# Ketupat

On May 2, 2022, Muslims around the world will celebrate Eid al-Fitr together. There are at least 1.9 billion Muslims who will be happy on that day. We who live in Indonesia, as a country with the largest Muslim population in the world, have our own characteristics in celebrating Eid al-Fitr. One of them is by cooking **Ketupat**.

**Ketupat** is a food wrapped in woven young coconut leaves filled with rice. Ketupat was introduced by Sunan Kalijaga in the 15th century in Indonesia. And until now, Ketupat is used as a special Eid al-Fitr food that must be present at least once a year.

Through this **Ketupat** Swift Playground, I would like to express my happiness in welcoming Eid al-Fitr in Indonesia by introducing **Ketupat** to the world. This playground contains a **Ketupat** weaving game which is very easy and fun to play. I hope that this Eid al-Fitr momentum can be felt happiness not only for Muslims, but also for all humans on this earth.
